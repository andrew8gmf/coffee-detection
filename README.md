    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    The development of the research was based on the following stages
    for its realization: preparation of the images, configuration of the pre-trained models for
    customized training to the coffee trees, training of the model, testing of model with images
    captured by the authors at the “Shuji Nishimura” Technology College in the city of Pompeia,
    implementation of the model for detection in coffees trees in video format and development of
    the cumulative count of tree. The result generated was a machine learning model trained to
    detect coffee trees by video and cumulatively count each unit in the planting row. However, the
    adoption of this type of technology can contribute positively to the analysis of productivity by
    planted area and work together with specialists and companies that want to have this
    technology in their equipment.
